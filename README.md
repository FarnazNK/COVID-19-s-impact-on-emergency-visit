Introduction
This code preprocesses two dataframes, ED_Volumes_2019 and ED_Volumes_2020, to prepare the data for analysis. The code first converts the date columns in both dataframes to datetime format and adds a "Year" column to both dataframes to indicate the year of the visit.

Data Cleaning
The code then performs several data cleaning steps, including:

Handling null values in the TWIB columns
Converting the AGE_NUM and TWIB columns to int64 format
Removing outliers from the numerical columns (AGE_NUM and TWIB)
Calculating the difference between corresponding columns in ED_Volumes_2020 and ED_Volumes_2019
Outlier Detection
Outliers in the AGE_NUM and TWIB columns are detected using box plots, and any values outside of the median +/- 1.5 times the interquartile range are removed.

New Column Creation
The code creates a new column for each column common to both ED_Volumes_2019 and ED_Volumes_2020, with the new column name being the original column name followed by "_difference". The values in each new column are the difference between the corresponding values in ED_Volumes_2020 and ED_Volumes_2019.

Conclusion
This code performs important preprocessing steps to clean and prepare the ED_Volumes_2019 and ED_Volumes_2020 dataframes for analysis. The code handles missing values, removes outliers, and creates new columns to show the difference between corresponding columns in both dataframes.
